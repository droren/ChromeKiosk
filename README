This project contains files needed to using a pretty VANILLIA ubuntu installation, install
a xsession handler that limits the possibility to access the computer as much as possible, 
and starting up a chromium-browser window in fullscreen, displaying defined contents. 

Could be used as a base to display for example build-monitor webpage. 

Files: 

To be installed in /usr/share/xsessions/.

Settings to be set in ~<userid>/.config/chromium/Default
